# Fun with Random.org

Random.org is a web front-end to an atmospheric noise sensor, which can give us pretty good random numbers. It's the reverse from a noise cancelling filter, since it cancels everything BUT the noise. Weather conditions, solar flares, a full-moon can have little impact on this, since it focuses on getting the purest white noise possible from their hardware sensors. 

Completed:  Use the HTTP API for random.org ![](https://www.random.org/clients/http/) to get truly random numbers. Look out for the guidelines, or you may get banned!

Future tasks:  Using these random numbers create the following:

- An RGB bitmap picture of 128x128 pixels

- A white noise WAV sound sample of 3 seconds

- An RSA key pair
